Image Reconstruction
====================

There are currently two sets of tools for reconstructing Siemens twix_data acquired
using an *x_epi* sequence. If you run an **x_epi** sequence on another scanner, and have 
some data you would like to share, please get in
`touch <https://github.com/tblazey/x_epi/discussions>`_. Adding recon ability for other
scanners would be great!

#. Directly calling the :doc:`XData <api>` Python class
#. A :doc:`command line wrapper <cmd>`
