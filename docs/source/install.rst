Installation
------------

Currently, x_epi requries Python 3.10. If you don't have 3.10, please 
`install <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010>`_ it first. 

If you have multiple versions of Python, it is often makes things to use a virtual 
environment specific for x_epi:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.10 -m venv "x_epi"
    source x_epi/bin/activate

Once you have Python 3.10, the easiest way to install **x_epi** is with *pip*:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/tblazey/x_epi.git
    

This will install the Python libraries as well as the *x_epi_cmd*, *x_epi_gui*, and
*x_epi_recon* tools.

If you desire, you can also download the source directly from the 
`Github repository <https://github.com/tblazey/x_epi/>`_.
